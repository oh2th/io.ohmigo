OHMIGO® Ohm On WiFi can send resistance as an output signal and can replace your current temperature sensor.
In almost all types of control systems there are sensors that detect and control the current temperature.
What if one could easily replace such a temperature sensor with a new type of component that can simulate any temperature and that can be connected to the internet?
